# React demo for user view
This project was bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
#####
This demo project contains basic user view system where a user can register, login and upload pics in his profile.
#####
User can view the uploaded pics of other users too.
#####
As this is a demo project just to showcase my front end skills, I haven't used any API but instead used local storage for saving all data.
####
### This basic demo contains:
* SASS implementation with standard [architecture](https://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture)
* ESLint configuration and implementation
* Data manipulation in local storage 
####
### To run the project
#### In development environment
> npm i

> npm start

> npm run watch:sass

#### In production environment

> npm i

> npm run build:sass

> npm run build

> serve -s build

### To fetch ESLint issues

> npm run eslint

### To auto-fix ESLint issues

> npm run eslint-fix

    NOTE: Some ESLint issues may need to be fixed manually
